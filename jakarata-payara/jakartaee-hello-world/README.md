# Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE
This is a sample application generated by the Eclipse Foundation starter for Jakarta EE.

You can run the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) appropriate for your Jakarta EE version and runtime choice (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

```
./mvnw clean package payara-micro:start
```

Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080.


# Project

This is a demo project for personal learning purposes. The goal is to create a simple REST API that interacts with a database. The project uses the Payara runtime and communicates with a Postgres database using JPA.

### Running from the paraya cli using the Postgres Driver
```
java -jar <jar file> --addlibs <path to postgres driver> --systemproperties micrprofile.properties datasource-def.war
```
- The --systemproperties flag is used to pass in the properties file that contains the database connection information.
- In the example we are telling the app to use the properties in the microprofile.properties file that should be in the root level of the project.
